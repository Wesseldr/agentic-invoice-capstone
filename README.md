# 🧾 Agentic Invoice Processor (Capstone Project)

> **A Tiered, Self-Correcting Multi-Agent System for High-Precision Invoice Extraction**

## 📖 Project Overview

This project implements an intelligent **Multi-Agent System** designed to extract structured data from diverse invoice formats.

**The Challenge:**
This solution is built for a Dutch healthcare administration office managing **150+ independent health professionals**. Every professional submits hours using their own unique invoice layout (Word, Excel, PDF export), making traditional template-based extraction impossible.

**The Solution:**
Unlike standard "wrapper" solutions, this system employs a **Hybrid Architecture** combining deterministic software engineering (Regex) with probabilistic AI (LLMs). 

The **Self-Correcting Orchestrator** actively monitors data quality. When critical fields (such as KvK or VAT numbers) are missing from the raw text, the system automatically triggers an **OCR Tool** (Google Cloud Vision) and performs a **Tiered Extraction Strategy** — *Regex first*, *LLM second*—to recover missing data without hallucination.


### 🏢 Real-World Context (Enterprise Vision)

This project demonstrates the **intelligent core** of an automated administrative pipeline designed to streamline therapeutic healthcare administration. It solves the tedious task of validating coaching and mediation hours against an internal Case Management System.

**The Bottleneck:**
Processing invoices is a critical operational bottleneck. Validation requires cross-referencing diverse PDF layouts against strict internal Client Case files. Manual processing is prone to **"stare-and-compare" fatigue**, leading to billing errors and privacy risks. Where traditional Regex parsers fail on layout variety and "blind" LLM extraction hallucinates codes, this agent provides a robust solution.

In a production environment, this agent integrates into the workflow as follows:

* **Ingestion:** Fetches PDF invoices automatically from a dedicated invoice ingestion channel (e.g., Google Workspace Gmail API).
* **Validation:** Cross-references extracted Case IDs and billable hours against the internal **Case Management System**.
* **Human-in-the-Loop:** Administrators review a generated validation report to make the final accept/reject decision, allowing them to focus purely on exceptions rather than routine data entry.

* **Output:** Upon approval, the validated data updates the case tracking records, and the PDF is forwarded to the accounting cloud for *payment processing.*

**Scope of this Submission:** For this Capstone, a standalone, reproducible version of the core engine is provided using synthetic invoice data and a `valid_clientcases.csv` lookup table to simulate external systems.

**System Boundaries:**
* **In Scope (The Core):** The Orchestrator, Agents, and Tools (Regex/OCR) represent the actual codebase submitted for this Capstone.
* **Context (Simulated):** The Ingestion (Gmail) and Enterprise Systems (Accounting/Client DB) represent the production environment. For this demonstration, these external dependencies are mocked using the synthetic dataset to ensure reproducibility.

### 🤖 The Agents
The workload is split between two specialized agents to reduce context window noise and improve accuracy:
* **🤖 HeaderAgent:** Specialized in administrative metadata (Supplier Name, Dates, Totals, KvK, VAT). It handles complex layouts where header info might be hidden in footers or sidebars.
* **🤖 LineItemAgent:** Specialized in tabular data. It extracts client case numbers, dates, and hours. It enforces strict validation rules against a known "Allowed Client Cases" list.

### 🧠 The Orchestrator & Tool Use
The `InvoiceOrchestrator` manages the lifecycle:
1.  **Dispatch:** Sends prompts to both agents in parallel (Async).
2.  **Validation:** Checks if critical fields (KvK/VAT) are null.
3.  **Self-Correction (The "Tiered Strategy"):**
    * *Trigger:* If metadata is missing, it activates the **Google Vision OCR Tool**.
    * *Tier 1 (Cost-Efficient):* Attempts to find the missing data in the OCR text using **Deterministic Regex**.
    * *Tier 2 (AI Fallback):* Only if Regex fails, it re-prompts the `HeaderAgent` with the new OCR context to "fill in the blanks".

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools Used

* **Google Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite:** The core LLM for reasoning and extraction.
* **Google Cloud Vision API:** Used as a fallback tool for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on challenging PDFs (logos, footers).
* **Regex (Custom Tool):** A shared library (`regex_tools.py`) used for high-speed, zero-cost pattern matching and tiered extraction.
* **Google ADK (Agent Development Kit):** For managing agent prompts and runners.
* **Polars & PDFPlumber:** For high-performance data processing and initial text extraction.

## 📊 Evaluation & Design Decisions

### Methodology & Test Dataset
To ensure production readiness, the system was evaluated against a "Golden Set" of 13 invoices, each designed to test a specific architectural component or failure mode.

| Invoice ID | Challenge / Edge Case | Agent Behavior & Solution |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0001** | **Baseline:** Standard layout, clean text. | ✅ **Pass:** Instant extraction via Regex (Tier 1). |
| **0002** | **Legacy Bug:** Code contains `0` instead of `O` (`DEM0-`). | 🛠️ **Fix:** Fuzzy Matcher detects ambiguity & auto-corrects to `DEMO-`. |
| **0003** | **Legacy Bug:** Code contains `1` instead of `I` (`30I`). | 🛠️ **Fix:** Fuzzy Matcher auto-corrects to `301` based on canonical mapping. |
| **0004** | **Hidden Data:** KvK/VAT only present in footer image (not text). | 🤖 **Agentic:** Triggers **Vision OCR** → **Regex** extracts data instantly. *Tier 2 (LLM) skipped*. |
| **0005** | **Invalid Data:** Contains non-existent Client Case ID. | 🛑 **Reject:** Gatekeeper correctly flags invoice as invalid/fraudulent. |
| **0006** | **Complex Layout:** Hours hidden in "Quantity" column, date in description. | 🧠 **Logic:** LineItemAgent correctly parses semantic context of columns. |
| **0007** | **Narrative:** No table; sessions described in full sentences. | 🧠 **Logic:** Agent successfully "unrolls" text sentences into structured line items. |
| **0008** | **Ambiguity:** Invoice number hidden in sentence ("onder nummer..."). | 🛡️ **Safety:** Agent returns `null` instead of guessing, adhering to strict precision policy. |
| **0009** | **Layout Noise:** Client logo larger than Supplier logo. | ⚠️ **Limit:** Supplier name ambiguous (flagged for Human Review); KvK/VAT extracted correctly. |
| **0010** | **Unit Conversion:** Time reported in minutes (60, 30) instead of hours. | 🧮 **Calc:** Agent detects unit context and converts to hours (1.0, 0.5). |
| **0011** | **Volume:** Multi-page document with high volume of lines. | ✅ **Pass:** Full pagination consistency check. |
| **0012** | **Zero-Billable:** Contains case numbers with 0 hours/cost. | 🧹 **Clean:** Agent segregates these into a separate `NoActivity` list to keep ledger clean. |
| **0013** | **Scope Creep:** Consultancy invoice (billable hours but no patient codes). | 🛑 **Reject:** Gatekeeper identifies "Out of Scope" and routes to Finance (not Healthcare). |


### Challenges & "Precision-First" Policy
During development, we encountered ambiguous data. For example, Invoice 0008 contains a potential invoice number hidden in a sentence ("onder nummer...").
* **Design Choice:** We tuned the Agent to be **conservative**. Unless a number is explicitly labeled as an Invoice Number, the Agent returns `null`.
* **Reasoning:** In financial automation, "no data" (flagged for human review) is safer than "incorrect data" (polluting the ledger).

### Results
The final evaluation run achieved a **98.7% Accuracy Score** across the complex test set. 
Critically, the system achieved **100% accuracy on Line Items and Client Case IDs**, proving that the core business logic is watertight. The minor deviation was limited to non-critical metadata (see below), confirming that the Agent adheres strictly to safety policies.

### Known Limitations
**Note on Supplier Identification:**
In rare edge cases (e.g., `Invoice 0009`), the extraction of the "Supplier Name" can be ambiguous when layouts heavily feature the client's branding. Currently, this is mitigated by the **Human-in-the-Loop** review step. Since the unique **KvK and VAT numbers are extracted correctly**, the correct entity is always identifiable, ensuring data integrity in the downstream accounting process.

* **Future Optimization:** I plan to implement a deterministic **API Lookup** against the Chamber of Commerce (KvK) register. By querying the extracted KvK number directly, the system can resolve the official legal entity name programmatically, eliminating any potential ambiguity from the visual layout.
